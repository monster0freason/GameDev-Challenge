# 🎯 Console-Based Guessing Game  

## 📝 Overview  
This project is a simple console-based number guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it. This challenge introduces you to core programming concepts such as control flow, user input handling, and basic game loops.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack Options  
- 🐍 **Python**: Great for beginners with its clear syntax.  
- 💻 **C++**: Learn about low-level programming and memory management.  
- 🌐 **JavaScript (Node.js)**: Run your game in the terminal or browser.  

## 📚 What You Will Learn  
✅ **Random Number Generation** – Generate and work with random values.  
✅ **User Input Handling** – Collect and validate input from users.  
✅ **Game Loop Construction** – Build a loop that runs until the game ends.  
✅ **Conditional Logic** – Utilize `if/else` statements to handle game rules.  
✅ **Basic Debugging** – Develop strategies for troubleshooting your code.  

## 🚀 How to Move Forward  
1️⃣ **Plan the Flow** – Outline the sequence: start, input, check, repeat.  
2️⃣ **Set Up Your Environment** – Install Python, C++ compiler, or Node.js.  
3️⃣ **Write Your Pseudocode** – Detail the steps in plain language before coding.  
4️⃣ **Implement Step-by-Step** – Begin with random number generation and input handling.  
5️⃣ **Test Frequently** – Run the game often to catch and fix bugs early.  
6️⃣ **Enhance Your Game** – Add difficulty levels, score tracking, or a replay option.
